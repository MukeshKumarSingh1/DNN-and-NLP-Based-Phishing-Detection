# DNN-and-NLP-Based-Email-Phishing-Detection
The DNN and NLP-Based Email Phishing Detection Model employs deep neural networks (DNN) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to effectively identify phishing emails. By analyzing email content through 26 features, including text patterns, sender information, and language cues, the model can distinguish legitimate messages from phishing attempts. NLP techniques are used to process and understand the textual context, identifying suspicious phrases, deceptive language, and abnormalities in sentence structure that are commonly used in phishing schemes. The DNN component leverages these features to model complex relationships and make accurate predictions. With its advanced understanding of both language and behavior, this model provides a powerful solution to protect users from phishing attacks, offering a scalable, real-time detection system that is both accurate and efficient.
